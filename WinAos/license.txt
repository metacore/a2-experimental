This is a compilation of the 
- ETH Plugin Oberon System 
running on an 
- Active Objects System (also referred as "Aos" or "Bluebottle") Kernel
and 
- the software packages Voyager and AntsInFields. 


Nearly all parts of this compilation belong to the ETH Oberon Plugin System, exceptions are the files with 
prefix "Aos" and the files of "AntsInFields" and "Voyager", stored in the directories "Work/ants" 
and "Work/vy" respectively.

----

Oberon is the name of a modern integrated software environment. It is a single-user, 
multi-tasking system that runs on bare hardware or on top of a host operating system. 
Oberon is also the name of a programming language in the Pascal/Modula tradition. 
The Oberon project was launched in 1985 by Niklaus Wirth and Jürg Gutknecht.

Voyager is a project to explore the feasibility of a portable and extensible system 
for simulation and data analysis systems. It is mainly written in and for Oberon. 
The Voyager project is carried out by StatLab Heidelberg and was launched 
in 1993 by Günther Sawitzki.

AntsInFields is a Software Package for Simulation and Statistical Inference on Gibbs Fields.
AntsInFields is written in Oberon and uses Voyager. It has been developed since 1997
by Felix Friedrich.

  ETH Zentrum, CH-8092 Zuerich. Refer to the "General ETH Oberon System 
  Source License" contract available at: http://www.oberon.ethz.ch/ *)

(3) The source code and each conversion resulting from its utilization must 
be provided with the name Oberon and designate as author the "Team of the 
Institute for Computer Systems of ETH Zuerich" at the beginning. Any further
developments, updates and applications must be marked "based on Oberon".

(4) Modifications by the Licensee are to be clearly identified.


Article 5  Consequences of Infringements

Each infringement of these license terms shall directly result in the loss of
the rights granted in Article 2. There shall be no right to distribute those
products which have been produced in violation of this contract.


Article 6  Information

(1) Upon request the Institute (e-mail: oberon@inf.ethz.ch) shall provide the
Licensee with information on modifications, updates and further developments
of the source code by the Institute.

(2) Upon request the Licensee and each Sub-Licensee shall disclose to the
Institute their applications, modifications, updates and further developments
of the source code as well as the thereby gained experiences and knowledge.


Article 7  Liability

(1) The Institute does not assume any liability for damage directly or 
indirectly caused by the application of the source code.
