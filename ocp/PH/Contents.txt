PHRegistries.Mod	Generic, but simple base class of a registry, for storage and retrieval
PHUserRegistry.Mod	User database including userid, password, domain, and hash. The password is only stored as a hash, not in plain text.

PHWebSyndication	RSS feed reader/aggregator/handler. should handle RSS and Atom formats; the latter is still buggy.
