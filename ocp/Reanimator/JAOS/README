JVM CVS

JVM/source
	the oberon sources for the JVM
JVM/classpath
	the java sources for building the java API


Using JVM/classpath

The Java APIs have been modified for the Oberon JVM. To allow synchronization
with the GNU Classpath project we rely on CVS source management.

We only use the java/* directory of the classpath release (the one containing the java sources). oberon/* is added for our own java classes.

* Updating the API when a new classpath version is released:

1) download the newest version from www.classpath.org
2) unpack it: tar -xzf
3) keep only the java directory, remove non *.java files
4) add it to cvs:
	cvs import -m "classpath X.XX" JVM/classpath classpath classpath-X-XX
5) merge
	cvs checkout -jclasspath:yesterday -jclasspath JVM/classpath
6) controll changed classes
7) rebuild
